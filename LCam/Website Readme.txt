The website for this was hosted locally via
xampp on a local apache server. The idea was for 
everything to be self sustaining and the database
would only be updated daily to ensure the device 
is self sufficient.The export for the license plate 
csv as well as image folder are hard coded for this folder as 
this would be controlled when deployed on an integrated system.
Currently the system outputs are stored within LCam/fromCam
