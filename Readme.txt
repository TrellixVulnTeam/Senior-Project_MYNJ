Plate detection was created and trained within jupyter notebook 
within a python 3.9.7 environment "detectorEnv".
For GPU acceleration to work correctly the correct nvidia drivers must be installed 
and correctly installed within the environment variables alongside cudNN. 
The trained tensorflow model is located in Tensorflow/workspace/models/my_ssd_mobnet.

The website is located within the LCam folder. 
The website was ran locally on an apache server via xampp.
